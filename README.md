# asp-net-mvc-hello-world

Simple "Hello World" app using ASP.NET MVC pattern. 

The app simply accepts text as input. When a user submits the text, the input is displayed in the page's title.

**NOTE**: This app only utlilizes the View and Controller portions of the MVC pattern. I chose this design because the app does not store any data, thus a model is not needed.
